Do you have a unique personality in mind for our AI model, GirlfriendGPT? Great! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to add it.

## Step 1: Define Your Personality
First, you'll need to define your personality. This is done by creating a new Python file in the src/personalities directory.

For example, if your personality is named "jane", you would create a file called `jane.py`. Inside this file, you would define the characteristics and behaviors that embody "jane". This could include her speaking style, responses to certain inputs, or any other defining features you envision.


## Step 2: Update __init__.py
Once you've created and fleshed out your personality file, it's time to make our codebase aware of it. Open __init__.py in the `src/personalities` directory.

Import your new personality at the top of the file and add your personality to the __all__ list:


```python
from .luna import luna
from .sacha import sacha
from .lucas import lucas  # This is your new personality

__all__ = [
    "sacha",
    "luna",
    "lucas",  # Add your personality here
    "get_personality"
]
```

Lastly, add your personality to the get_personality() function:

```python
def get_personality(name: str):
    try:
        return {
            "luna": luna,
            "sacha": sacha,
            "lucas": lucas  # Add your personality here
        }[name]
    except Exception:
        raise Exception("The personality you selected does not exist!")
```

And that's it! Now, whenever the `get_personality` function is called with the name of your personality, it will return the behaviors and characteristics defined in your personality file.

## Step 3: Test and Submit

Before you submit your new personality, please test it to ensure everything works as expected. If all is well, submit a Pull Request with your changes, and be sure to include the title "{name} - {description}" where {name} is your personality's name, and {description} is a brief explanation of the personality.

Good luck, and we can't wait to meet your new GirlfriendGPT personality!
